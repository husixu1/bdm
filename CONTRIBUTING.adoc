Contributing Guidelines
=======================

Generally, all kinds of contributions are welcome. Just note that:

* Merge to the `dev` branch, or open another branch for an individual topic. The `master` branch are for releasing.

Notice the following points for bash code contribution:

* Avoid adding mandatory runtime dependencies to BDM, especially executables not included in https://www.maizure.org/projects/decoded-gnu-coreutils/[coreutils], examples are `sed`, `awk`, and `grep`.
* If dependencies are to be added to enhance the functionality, they should be optional. i.e. BDM can still run without them.
* Format bash files with https://github.com/mvdan/sh[shfmt] before firing pull requests. Codes are indented with 4 spaces except for here-document (`<<-EOF...EOF`).
* Make sure all tests pass. Add/modify corresponding tests if necessary.

If unsure, open an issue. :)
